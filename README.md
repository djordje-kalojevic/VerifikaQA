# VerifikaQA
Allows performing Verifika quality assurance checks without loading the program and fiddling with dialogues.

Speeds up the process dramatically if you (like me) have to do these dozens of times a day.

Now, works for both optimized and unoptimized reports!

Please note that you still need to have a valid Verifika licence.
